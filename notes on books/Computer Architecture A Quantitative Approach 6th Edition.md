# Chapter Two Memory Hierarchy Design
## Introduction

- unlimited amount of fast memory? â†’ hierarchies based on memories of different speeds and sizes
	- locality (non-uniformly access to code or data)
		- temporal locality
		- spatial locality
	- trade-offs in the cost-performance of memory technologies
	- **goal**
		- a cost per byte almost as low as the cheapest level of memory
		- a speed almost as fast as the fastest level
